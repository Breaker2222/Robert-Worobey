<!--Hello, maker! Welcome to my Electrate Fuego web design tutorial. I'm glad you found it – for this might be a real intersection on your way to becoming. I (S.J. Quigley) use this document in my Technical Communications classes at the University of Pittsburgh to teach my students a little bit about computer science and something called "electracy." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll make a really cool web documemt that not only introduces you to the other people in our classes, but will help you process how different discourse communities in your life have contributed to your arrival in this space, virtual and actual, and also contribute to where you might be going. 

In this doc, you will work through Gregory Ulmer's discourses of career, family, entertainment, community, and schooling (_Internet Invention From Literacy to Electracy_, 2002.) In Ulmer's text, he elides community and schooling into one category, but for our puposes I have separated them. Ulmer's theory of electracy helps makes sense of how we find/construct meaning and connect with others rhetorically in a media rich ecology. Ulmer uses analogy to define electracy, explaining that "electracy is to digital media what literacy is to print." 

You could make this document the easy way by posting on Google Site, an Adobe Spark, a Weebly, or a Wix--or you can do a little more work to unconceal, opening up these tools that you use every day, but might not know how they function, yet prove so necessary to how you (re)present yourself and connect with others in virtual spaces. And this last bit is an important point! If we really want to be makers, if we really want to be creative, then we need to understand what our digital tools do, how they work, and consider the implications of their use. Through this process you will alos learn a little bit about computer literacy and computer science. Enough to allow you to build web texts and understand file management. 

So let's cut this thing open – using "tmesis" as the Ancient Greeks would call it – lets "cut" and arrange, tweak, take away and augment...that's how we create! I hope you're excited to use this tool to create a document that will simultaneously help you process your journey and help orient you along the path on which you are headed in your becoming. Before we get going I would like to give a shout-out to my research buddy Shauna Chung, who helped me develop the original Ulmerian framework we will be following in this document. Are you ready to get started?--> 
    
 <!--To get started, you will need to fork my repository from GitHub if you haven't already. If you want to easily publish it on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. But for right now, fork, and then download the website to a zip file (or clone it, if you know what that means). Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and organize your other assests like images, pdfs, etcetera. You will also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "atom.io" or "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the style.css and index.html documents in the text editor and we can get started building our own electrate experience.--> 

<!--BTW. You can leave these hidden HTML text fields be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--First we will need to do some work in the head of the document. The head organizes important information needed to expalin to browsers how the website will work. Go ahead and change the title of this HTML document below, from "Electrate Fuego" to whatever you want it to be called. Your new text will appear in your browser tab-->
    
<title>Worobey A sparrow's lessons learned the hardest way</title>
    
    <!--this next section of code does important work to help different browsers understand what this page should look like on the different kinds of screens.--> 
    
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    
     <!--this code tells the browser to link to the style.css file that controls the appearance of much of your content.--> 
    
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">

<!--The body of the document houses the content that a user usually sees on a website. We'll be spending most of our time in this section.-->
    
<body>
       
<!-- We'll need to do some more work in this section, but to do so, we'll need to make some changes on your style.css file. Developers refer to this division as a "Hero Block," but we will refer to it as a "Wide Image."  Think carefully about the image you select and how it might serve a sybolic function in your life. Ulmer refers to these kinds of symbolic images as "wide images" in that they often repeat over and over in our lifetime. We will similarly repeat this image at the end of your Electrate Infuego composition to establish a motif in this web document.  

Place a .jpg or .png in the same file folder as this project (hint: simplify the name). You don't need to do anything on this html page, but you'll need to change the background image name on the style.css page to match you image asset.

Now, change the other relevant information in this section, especially if you're not John en Fuego or not majoring in "electracy"-->

      <!--In our first exploration of discourse, we're going to think about the wider characteristics or themes of our field or future career. In academia, we do a lot of work narrowing our interest to arrive at a career or profession, often reducing our field to a level of operation or an act. Instead, I would like you to think more broadly about the "wider themes" you associate with your field or future career and its larger significance in improving our world. Yes--improving the world. Thinking back, where do you see exposure to those same "wider themes" in your own life? Those ah-ha moments, lessons, examples, tools, passions, or qualities that suggested this career path to you? Replace the content between <h2> and </h2> that begins with "Lorem ipsum."-->

  <h2>Improving the world one emergency at a time while serving at USCG Station Golden Gate made me understand that I should develop my talents so that I can multiply the number of lives I save.  Operating a 40,000 lb surf boat to tow distressed mariners away from the rocks gave me a sense of pride. However, in the hours that it took to reach the poor souls, I kept thinking that it shouldn't take this long for help to arrive.  Since I was no admiral that could move large sums of money around to effect change, I decided to go back to school.  I figured that by earning engineering credentials I could apply both my experience and knowledge to the industry which designs life saving systems.

  <h2>Family for me has been an adaptive state since I graduated high school. Jumping straight into boot camp at the USCGA and having 30 people that will be at your side through blood sweat and tears can change your perspective of family.  Eight weeks of suffering and with little bits of peace sprinkled on top made me understand that family was not as simple as who your parents and siblings are.  When I was sent to my first unit, I had to look for family wherever I could find it.  Friends come and go, but every now and then you get the chance to add a member to you family.  I found my best friend at age 24 by offering my help to move hime and his fiance into the apartment above mine.  A little bit of forceful kindness on both of our parts displayed to each other what kind of people we were.  Ever since then, there has only been shared support for each others lives.  He now lives in New Zealand, but distance doesn't mean very much to me.  Just because you can't physically be present does not mean that you have the inability to help your friends through tough situations.  I transferred to Surf Station Golden Gate for the purpose of chasing large waves and pulling a much larger amount of people out of the water.  The one thing that I didn't expect was to meet my soulmate.  My family didn't really expand or retract much until I met the love of my life in San Francisco.  It seems as though love finds you when you're not looking for it.  After finding out that I couldn't live without my her, I decided to propose. I asked her to spend the rest of her life with me underneathe the Golden Gate bridge on the bow of my rescue boat.  Adding her to my family was the smartest decision I had ever made.  My wife's support meant and still means the world to me.  It was her support that influenced my to end my active duty career in the Coast Guard and pursue my education.  Right at the end of my tour at USCG Station Golden Gate, my son was born and we were soon on our way across the country to Pittsburgh.  The question of where I'm now going depends strongly on what's best for my family.  They come first because we support each other no matter what changes us.

<!--Now we are moving into the kinds of media that contributes to your everyday discourse. This might sound weird, but Ulmer argues that media has actually contributed a great deal to who you are as a person, how you language yourself, and even how you move through the world and interact with others. So, let's take some time to explore this discourse area. You have the opportunity to add video content or other significant media content. You might also add images to this section (see the bottom of this sheet for directions on how to add elements) perhaps adding a photo grid like the one you did for the "Family" section. Experiment.

While we often think of communities as neighborhoods and clubs and a group of colleagues or friends, you might find community across the frontiers of the dead, and perhaps even with those who have never lived. I'll let you explain. -->
    
  <h2>My community spans between actual and virtual, depending on the space I'm in at the time.  My actual community exists while I'm at work as a reservist.  This community includes people from all parts of our workforce.  We are a group of colleagues that care about our families and work to keep that community intact and safe one weekend a month.  When we depart company, there are many lessons learned that we take back to our individual communties.  My virtual community is a forum for heavy equipment owners.  I joined this community after purchasing a 1969 Case 580ck backhoe.  The amount of knowledge and experience in this community flows to everyone who joins.  I find myself feeling grounded when I'm actively using the forum to work through an issue with my Case.  Working toward a common goal makes me feel as though I'm apart of a great community, whether it's large or small, virtual or real.

  <h2>This education that I started over a decade ago is no longer a means to "get a job" or even make money.  That may have been how my scholastic journey started.  It will however, end with an engineering degree that I can use to make lives better.  Two and a half years at the Coast Guard Academy was a great starting experience.  I learned humility, dicipline, and the ability to harness my will power.  I did not learn how to succeed academically though.  My expectations of cruising through the Academy and landing a wonderful life afterwards were too optimistic.  I ended up splitting me knee in half along with my grades shortly afterwards, then dropping out while I healed. Eight years of active duty in the enlisted ranks after that I ended up at the University of Pittsburgh with the intention of finishing my educational battle.  While I've been here I managed to secure a stellar student/work job at HERL(Human Engineering Research Laboratory) where I've gained real world experience in designing working prototypes that benefit disabled veterans.  I'm still here and plan to finish the fight by networking this final year to find the near perfect fit at a company that I can serve the best with my skillset.
